# Adventures in LA LA LAND

https://lizhen-zhu.github.io/lala-land/index.html



### Summary:

This is a commercial website with movie theme, based on the movie 'LA LA LAND'. Using a virtual piano to lead users play the first two sentences of ' city of stars', with the rest of the song automatically start playing, leading users to the movie trailer, clicking the map and showing them the movie scenes and videos. At the end, link the movie to their real life and offer them a ticket to begin their own romance stories.

I want usersÂ have a taste of the movie within the time of a song and explore all the possibilities by themselves. With the music, the virtual effect and the interaction, people could have a deeper understanding towards the story itself and also the message that the movie want to tell us.


### Inspiration:
Why is making such a project important to you?

'LA LA LAND' is my favorite movie, and I was really touched by it beautiful scenes and amazing soundtracks. I want to use my own way to interpret this movie and take advantage of the JavaScript to offer users interaction with the story.



### Process and important functions
#### Page One -Piano
The first page of this website is a black background with a simple virtual piano, then 3s later, the dancing people show up. 
People may feel confused at the first time since I didn't tell them what they should do and what to expect.Users should explore the page by themselves.
By pressing the key, the alert shows up and tell them what to do. Then following the correct instruction, they will find the secret key to enter the LALALAND. And the user will be surprised by what they did since this four key is also the first sound of the theme music, which is also connected to the next page.
In summary, this page is intend to lead users getting into the story by themselves, with the piano serving as a password. 



#### Page Two -Trailer
After they step into the story, here comes to the official trailer with the big movie name. The sound start to play after we press the right keyboard. With the romantic music and movie scene, users could better understand the theme and content of this movie. What is more, there is a comment section that is renewed every 5 seconds, telling more information to the users about this movie.

#### Page Three- Cast
By clicking the navigation bar on the top, the page will lead you to the other section. In the cast part, there are 2 characteristics. The CSS animation enbales users to hover over the picture; JavaScript create the typing lyrics. The combination of two effects create the illusion that the main actors are telling you the story right now.


#### Page Four- Map
In the map section, I want to create a mixed reality to users. Since this story was happened in LA, I create a svg map to represent the real world. Users could click on each part, and the scene that happened in that area will show up, leading users to explore the story as well as the LA city.

#### Page Five- Ticket
In the last section, typing words show again. The reverse of the worlds tell users that the end of this story dose not mean the end of everthing. I try to connect the movie to the real world by asking them to create their own story. 
I offer them a input section that they can type in the name of a person that they care about. Then, the name will automaticlly fill in the next ticket page that they can use for a real-world invivation to someone. 

Movie story may have an ending, but our story just begin. Hi, can I invite you to watch a movie with me?
